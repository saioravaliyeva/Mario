					<span>PUBG</span> - Massively Multiplayer Online Battle Royale game developed and published by PUBG
					Corporation, a
					subsidiary
					of Korean publisher Bluehole. The official distribution of the game in Russia is handled by Mail.Ru
					Group.
					The game is based on previous modifications for other games created by Brendan Greene under the pseudonym
					"PlayerUnknown", the concept of which was inspired by the Japanese film Battle Royale in 2000.
					This ultimately led to the creation of a standalone game, where Green acted as the lead game designer. In
					the game there are up to 100 players who parachute onto the island, after which they are looking for
					equipment and weapons to kill other participants and at the same time stay alive. The available safe zone
					on the in-game map begins to shrink over time, making the available space tighter to push players against
					each other. The last surviving player or team wins the round.

					<span>Fortnite</span> is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is
					available in three
					distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite:
					Save the World, a cooperative hybrid-tower defense-shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight
					off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; Fortnite
					Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person
					standing; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle
					arenas. Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was
					released on December 6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for
					Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural
					phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of
					dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue up until December 2019.

				<p>
					<span>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</span>is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed
					by
					Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It
					is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was
					released
					for Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. Valve still
					regularly
					updates the game, both with smaller balancing patches and larger content additions.
					The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different
					objective-based
					game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists
					attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have
					captured.
					There are nine official game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode.
					The
					game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition
					to
					community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone",
					was
					introduced in December 2018.
